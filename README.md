This repo tells the story of objectiving emotions.
We started our microchallenge by extensively specifying our interests and overlap between them.

*Finding common ground*

### Initial idea
  
After defining 'sculpting emotions' as previsional common topic we raised the idea to create a tool which allows any user to communicate emotions better. 
Since we're both interested in social and emotional design this thematic was close to our interests.

### What are sculpted emotions?
  â€¢ Objects that give a emotions a form.

### Process
We started with a questioneer-style format in which the user defines his emotion through a series of questions.
In the questioneer the user begins by defining a shape by a series of variables which later gets colored based on answers on new series of variables.

*Questioneer idea*

We went trough a series of iterations, mainly differentiating between UX interfaces and types of visuals. Ruben used visualization tools to interpret the different approach, which Nikita utilised as targets for P5.js script.

*Visualizing three dimensions*
We realized that a 2D ecosystem would not justify the complexity of the emotion so we added a dimension in
a series of new visualizations.

Now that we got a taste that emotions can be expressed through shapes we asked ourselves 'how?'. Starting in Blender complex shapes can be created relatively quickly. 
To have parametric functionality/adaptability on top of this was executed more convenient in Fusion.

  *The evolution on how the 3D geometry would be generated. Shifting from Blender to Fusion.*
  
 We continued by testing the parametric setup in Fusion with a series of divergent 'emotional inputs'; the parametric variables. This
 test resulted in the following series of items.

  *A series of 3D shapes created in Fusion.*

  
  
  Ultimately we created a Fusion file with eight parameters. Each parameter influences the shape in a way that 
  the extremer the emotional value, the extremer the resulting shape. This method led to some interesting shapes, one
  of which we SLA printed.

  *SLA printing.*
  
  The SLA printed rings after hardening.

  ### Applications
  Possible applications of Emo Sculpting include a webtool for users to check, log and track their emotional progression over time or just getting an impression
  how their current emotion looks like.

  Another use-case could be to print the items into jewellery that can be worn as statement for emotional design or individual expression.
